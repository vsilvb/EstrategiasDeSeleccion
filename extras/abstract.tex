\begin{abstract}
	Algebraic frameworks for information extraction model a document as a
	finite string and pattern matches as \emph{mappings} that bind variables
	to spans.  While recent automata-based techniques can enumerate \emph{all}
	mappings with delay linear in the size of each output, practical
	applications do not always require the full result: many mappings are redundant
	because they are \emph{strictly extended} by others that capture
	additional variables without altering previously assigned spans.
	The \emph{variable-inclusion skyline} (or \textsf{MAX}) operator removes
	this redundancy, retaining only maximal mappings.
	
	We provide a evaluation scheme that integrates \textsf{MAX}
	\emph{during} enumeration while preserving output-linear delay.
	Starting from a deterministic extended variable automaton (eVA)~$E$, we
	construct a product automaton $E_{\max}$ whose state pairs keep, in
	lock-step, a candidate run and a bounded set of dominating witnesses.
	A mapping is output exactly when no witness can still reach
	acceptance. These results establish that skyline selection can be
	incorporated into automata-based text extraction without sacrificing
	enumeration performance.
